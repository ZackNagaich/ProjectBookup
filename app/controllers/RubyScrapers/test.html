The Cat in the Hat is a childrens book written and illustrated by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and first published in 1957. The story centers on a tall anthropomorphic cat, who wears a red and white-striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat shows up at the house of Sally and her brother one rainy day when their mother is away. Ignoring repeated objections from the childrens fish, the Cat shows the children a few of his tricks in an attempt to entertain them. In the process he and his companions, Thing One and Thing Two, wreck the house. The children and the fish become more and more alarmed until the Cat produces a machine that he uses to clean everything up. He then disappears just before the childrens mother walks in.

Geisel created the book in response to a debate in the United States about literacy in early childhood and the ineffectiveness of traditional primers such as those featuring Dick and Jane. Geisel was asked to write a more entertaining primer by William Spaulding, whom he had met during World War II and who was then director of the education division at Houghton Mifflin. However, because Geisel was already under contract with Random House, the two publishers agreed to a deal: Houghton Mifflin published the education edition, which was sold to schools, and Random House published the trade edition, which was sold in bookstores.

Geisel gave varying accounts of how he created The Cat in the Hat, but in the version he told most often he was so frustrated with the word list from which he could choose words to write his story that he decided to scan the list and create a story based on the first two words he found that rhymed. The words he found were cat and hat. The book met with immediate critical acclaim and financial success. Reviewers praised it as an exciting alternative to traditional primers. Three years after its debut, the book had already sold over a million copies, and in 2001 Publishers Weekly listed the book at number nine on its list of best-selling childrens books of all time. The books success led to the creation of Beginner Books, a publishing house centered around producing similar books for young children learning to read. In 1983, Geisel said, &quot;It is the book Im proudest of because it had something to do with the death of the Dick and Jane primers.&quot; The book was adapted into a 1971 animated television special and  a 2003 live-action film.

Theodor Seuss Geisel ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|z|əl}}; March 2, 1904&amp;nbsp;– September 24, 1991) was an American writer, poet, and cartoonist. He was most widely known for his childrens books written and illustrated as Dr. Seuss. He had used the pen name Dr. Theophrastus Seuss in college and later used Theo LeSieg and Rosetta Stone.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Theodor Seuss Geisel&quot;. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved December 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geisel published 46 childrens books, often characterized by imaginative characters, rhyme, and frequent use of anapestic meter. His most-celebrated books include the bestselling Green Eggs and Ham, The Cat in the Hat, The Lorax, One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish, The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins, Fox in Socks, The Kings Stilts, Hop on Pop, Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose, Horton Hatches the Egg, Horton Hears a Who!, and How the Grinch Stole Christmas!. His works have spawned numerous adaptations, including 11 television specials, four feature films, a Broadway musical and four television series. He won the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958 for Horton Hatches the Egg and again in 1961 for And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street. Geisel also worked as an illustrator for advertising campaigns, most notably for Flit and Standard Oil, and as a political cartoonist for PM, a New York City newspaper. During World War II, he worked in an animation department of the United States Army, where he wrote Design for Death, a film that later won the 1947 Academy Award for Documentary Feature.

He was a perfectionist in his work and would sometimes spend up to a year on a book. It was not uncommon for him to throw out 95% of his material until he settled on a theme for his book. For a writer he was unusual in that he preferred to be paid only after he finished his work rather than in advance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reader&quot;/&gt;

Geisels birthday, March 2, has been adopted as the annual date for National Read Across America Day, an initiative on reading created by the National Education Association.


The Glass Bead Game ({{lang-de|link=no|Das Glasperlenspiel}}) is the last full-length novel of the German author Hermann Hesse. It was begun in 1931 and published in Switzerland in 1943 after being rejected for publication in Germany due to Hesses anti-Fascist views.&lt;ref&gt;Petri Liukkonen http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/hhesse.htm &quot;Herman Hesse&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, in 1946, Hesse went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. In honoring him in its Award Ceremony Speech, the Swedish Academy said that the novel &quot;occupies a special position&quot; in Hesses work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1946/press.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1946 – Hermann Hesse: Award Ceremony Speech|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Glass Bead Game&quot; is a literal translation of the German title, but the book has also been published under the title Magister Ludi, Latin for &quot;Master of the Game&quot;, which is an honorific title awarded to the books central character. &quot;Magister Ludi&quot; can also be seen as a pun: lud- is a Latin stem meaning both &quot;game&quot; and &quot;school&quot;. However, the title Magister Ludi is misleading, as it implies the book is a straightforward bildungsroman. In reality, the book touches on many different genres, and the bulk of the story is on one level a parody of the biography genre. {{cn|date=August 2013}}
